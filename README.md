# BadBank
This is a simple bank application written in React. It is called "Bad" Bank because of the lack of security features.

## Usage
To use:
- Ensure you have node version > 14, http-server, and yarn installed.
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the repo in your favorite terminal emulator
- Type `yarn install`
- Type `yarn dev`
- Have Fun :)

## Future Improvements
In the future I would like to clean the code up a bit and remove some redundancies. Connecting the front end to a backend such as Postgres or MongoDB would really complete it.
